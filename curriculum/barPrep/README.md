# Module creation prompt (used with o1, which put each module on a newline, which I actually preferred...)

Design a course outline for Baramu, a conversation-based bar exam prep course. Baramu is designed to prepare law students for all components of the bar exam -- MBE, MEE, and MPT. The modules you define in your outline will later be broken down into conversational/writing exercises designed to rewire participants' brains so they perform as well as they can.

Define each module in your outline in <module> tags, like so:

<module>Overview of bar exam structure</module>
<module>Structure of government</module>
<module>Judicial review</module>
...(etc)

Make sure that you provide a comprehensive set of modules -- it is important that the modules cover all areas of study.

Don't worry about the method of teaching used to get the content of these modules into students' heads -- that will be dealt with elsewhere. The only important thing is that you provide an outline of all of the subject matter areas that should be covered by the course.

# Topic population prompt (also used with o1)

Baramu is a bar exam prep course designed to prepare law students for all components of the bar exam -- MBE, MEE, and MPT. It dynamically generates conversations, essay assignments, and practical assignments designed to rewrire law students' brains so that they can perform as well as possible as quickly as possible.

Below is the module list covered by Baramu. For each module, create a comprehensive list of topics that should be covered. These topic lists should be comprehensive.

Don't specify *how* the topics will be covered -- that will be dealt with elsewhere. The only important thing is that the topic lists you provide encompass all of the subject matter that a student needs to learn to master the module area.
