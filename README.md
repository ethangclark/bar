# Baramu

Baramu: Learn dynamically.

Baramu is bar exam prep that's tailored specifically to you, delving deep and shining new light into weak areas, and blazing through areas where you're already strong.

Which do you learn faster from -- a lively conversation with someone who knows their stuff, or by rereading the same dry piece of study material for the eighth time?

Reverse the burn-out. Learn dynamically. Try Baramu for free.

# Module creation prompt (used with o1, which put each module on a newline, which I actually preferred...)

Design a course outline for Baramu, a conversation-based bar exam prep course. Baramu is designed to prepare law students for all components of the bar exam -- MBE, MEE, and MPT. The modules you define in your outline will later be broken down into conversational/writing exercises designed to rewire participants' brains so they perform as well as they can.

Define each module in your outline in <module> tags, like so:

<module>Overview of bar exam structure</module>
<module>Structure of government</module>
<module>Judicial review</module>
...(etc)

Make sure that you provide a comprehensive set of modules -- it is important that the modules cover all areas of study.

Don't worry about the method of teaching used to get the content of these modules into students' heads -- that will be dealt with elsewhere. The only important thing is that you provide an outline of all of the subject matter areas that should be covered by the course.
